# 🏆 Proof of Donation

**Proof of Donation** is a blockchain-based platform that empowers users to show their support for social and environmental causes by minting unique digital badges. This project serves both companies that already accept crypto, but implementing digital badges is too complicated for them (EFF, Tor). This project is built with **Next.js**, **Polygon**, **Web3Auth**, and **The Graph**, and integrates **Nouns art** to enhance user engagement and experience. It aims to foster a community-driven approach to philanthropy by connecting supporters with organizations that align with their values.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Blockchain**: Polygon PoS Amoy
- **Wallet Integration**: Web3Auth: Integrated the **Web3Auth Plug and Play Modal SDK** for seamless wallet connections and a frictionless user login experience.
- **Data Indexing**: The Graph
- **UI Enhancements**: TailwindCSS with Nouns art integration: Nouns art is featured in the user interface, enhancing the visual appeal of donation badges and providing a unique, recognizable identity to the platform, as well as in the digital badge itself.

## 🤝 Partners and Focus Areas

1. **Social Focus**:  
   Proof of Donation targets transparency in philanthropy, encouraging individuals to contribute towards causes like online privacy and internet freedom. It helps companies to strengthen their branding and fill the cultural gap between their current supporters and web3 generation.
   Example causes include:
   - **EFF**: Advocating for digital rights and privacy.
   - **TOR**: Supporting anonymous communication to protect privacy.

   Addresses the global need for increased transparency in philanthropy and incentivizes community-driven donations. Any organization can onboard supporters globally; individuals receive recognition for contributions through immutable digital badges without any special effort and need to manage it.
   Not a scammy protocol, but reliable tool from community to community.
   Expandable for corporate sponsorships, school fundraisers, and decentralized governance.

2. **Blockchain Relevance**:  
   The application leverages Polygon’s PoS network for fast, low-cost transactions and scalability, making it ideal for micro-donations and wide community adoption.

3. **Community Engagement**:  
   Displays live supporter counts and features vibrant visuals to drive user participation and collective action. In the future there will be possibility to support semi-projects under big brands and collect even more unique badges, show your collection of badges etc.
   
4. **Barriers**:
    Minimal transaction fees thanks to Polygon's low-cost infrastructure, accessible on standard devices via Web3Auth wallet integration, ensuring a decentralized yet easy-to-use platform.
